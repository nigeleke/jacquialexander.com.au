        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <img src="~/assets/images/jacquialexander.jpg" alt="Image of Jacqui" class="bio-shot" />

        <p>Jacqui started her career as a professional performer in cabaret and musical theatre. She started teaching
          voice over 20 years ago when her two daughters were born. Her choice was to be a committed parent, and so,
          teaching became the logical step from full time performing. Jacqui’s early start in the entertainment industry
          has given her an insight and understanding to performing from the student’s perspective. She totally
          understands first hand the young voice going through voice change, adolescence and maturity as a professional
          entertainer. The external pressures, the internal expectations and the self awareness, have all been roads
          Jacqui has travelled for herself, and as a teacher, has helped many young singers along the same journey.
          Jacqui still performs occasionally, both for the love of it and also to stay current with the demands on
          performers.</p>
        <p>Jacqui holds a high standard for herself as a teacher. She keeps up to date with the latest studies and
          developments in understanding the human voice. In 2005 she refreshed her voice studies at the Sydney
          Conservatorium of Music. She studied voice pedagogy through Somatic Voiceworks tm with Jeanette LoVetri at
          Shenandoah University, USA, passing all subjects with A Levels. She has also worked with a number of private
          tutors, including her mentor, the late Bob Tasman-Smith. She has been the vocal tutor for over 15 years at
          local Sutherland Primary & High Schools. Jacqui is a member of a number of professional organisations and, as
          such, maintains her professional development hours by attending the many conferences and seminars they offer
          annually, in particular those concerning the health & function of the voice.</p>
