        <p>After 26 years as a singing teacher and over 60 years performing in the music industry,
	  it is with much consideration, and a little sadness, that I decided to take retirement.</p>
	<p>Therefore the 'Jacqui Alexander Singing Studio' closed in November 2023.</p>
        <p>It has been an amazing time working with so many talented and creative students and I am
	  so very proud of each and every one of you. I have watched so many strive, achieve, stumble
	  and carry on regardless, and then finally grow into the wonderful humans you now are.
	  You have brought incredible joy and happiness into my life, and I will be forever grateful.
	  My wish is for you to continue sharing your love of music, and to fill your homes with the
	  magic it brings.</p>
	<p>I am looking forward to this next part of my life and whatever comes with it. If it is anywhere
	  as fulfilling as my life has been so far, then I am in for an exciting time.</p>
	<p>All the best and with much musical love,</p>
