      <p>I put off making this decision for some time as I have been concerned at leaving you
        all with no singing teacher in the area. However, recent moves have meant that I now
	have two singing studios that I can highly recommend.</p>
      <h4>Jessica Sibrava</h4>
      <p>Milton <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jsibravasoprano/">https://www.facebook.com/jsibravasoprano/</a></p>
      <p>Jess is a lovely teacher and has a wealth of experience and knowledge. Her classes
        are similar to mine insomuch as they are private lessons with a focus on technique
	while the learning is still fun.</p>
      <h4>South Coast Singing & Music</h4>
      <p>Ulladulla <a href="https://www.southcoastsingingandmusic.com/">https://www.southcoastsingingandmusic.com/</a></p>
      <p>Hanna & Bec are also lovely teachers and run a full music school in Ulladulla. They
        do private lessons and group classes which are good for young students.</p>
