She started teaching voice over 20 years ago when her two daughters were born. Her choice was to be a committed parent, and so, teaching became the logical step from full time performing. Jacqui’s early start in the entertainment industry has given her an insight and understanding to performing from the student’s perspective. She totally understands first hand the young voice going through voice change, adolescence and maturity as a professional entertainer. The external pressures, the internal expectations and the self awareness, have all been roads Jacqui has travelled for herself, and as a teacher, has helped many young singers along the same journey. Jacqui still performs occasionally, both for the love of it and also to stay current with the demands on performers.</p><p data-v-0c80cc24>Jacqui holds a high standard for herself as a teacher. She keeps up to date with the latest studies and developments in understanding the human voice. In 2005 she refreshed her voice studies at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. She studied voice pedagogy through Somatic Voiceworks tm with Jeanette LoVetri at Shenandoah University, USA, passing all subjects with A Levels. She has also worked with a number of private tutors, including her mentor, the late Bob Tasman-Smith. She has been the vocal tutor for over 15 years at local Sutherland Primary &amp; High Schools. Jacqui is a member of a number of professional organisations and, as such, maintains her professional development hours by attending the many conferences and seminars they offer annually, in particular those concerning the health &amp; function of the voice.</p></div><div class="about-section" data-v-0c80cc24><h3 data-v-0c80cc24>Memberships</h3><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>ANATS (Australian National Association of Teachers of Singing) – Full Member</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>AVA (Australian Voice Association) – Member</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>BVA (British Voice Association) – Member</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>ASPAH (Australian Society for Performing Arts Healthcare) – Member</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>ALVA (Australian Ladies Variety Association) – Life Member / Secretary</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Somatic Voicework(tm) Teachers Association – Member</li></ul></div><div class="about-section" data-v-0c80cc24><h3 data-v-0c80cc24>Certifications</h3><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Certificate for Self Employed People in child related employment (issued by NSW Commission for Children &amp; Young People)</li></ul></div><div class="about-section" data-v-0c80cc24><h3 data-v-0c80cc24>Qualifications</h3><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Somatic Voicework(tm)– The LoVetri Method – Shenandoah University USA; Certified Level III Teacher</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Sydney Conservatorium of Music, 2005 – Music Fundamentals, Sight Reading &amp; Ear Training</li></ul></div><div class="about-section" data-v-0c80cc24><h3 data-v-0c80cc24>Training</h3><h4 data-v-0c80cc24>Singing</h4><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Bob Tasman-Smith from 1983 – 1987</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Conservatorium of Music, Sydney 1983 – Jazz Extension Studies</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Claire Poole (Claire Poole Singers)</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>John Forrest, Paddington – Private Lessons</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Robert Montana, Bellevue Hill – Private Lessons</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Barry Ryan &amp; Sean Jessop – The Oxford SAMS</li></ul><h4 data-v-0c80cc24>Dance</h4><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Over 25 years in Jazz Ballet / Classical Ballet to Elementary RAD / Modern Dance / Tap</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Pineapple Dance Studios, London</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Bodenwiesser Dance Centre</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Coralie Hinkley (Student of Martha Graham)</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Australian Academy of Ballet</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Jenny Kaye School of Ballet</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Sylvia Simpson School of Dance</li></ul><h4 data-v-0c80cc24>Acting</h4><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Ensemble Studios – Hayes Gordon &amp; Zika Nester – 3 Years (Including Voice, Dancing, Fencing, Stage, TV &amp; Theatre Craft)</li></ul><h4 data-v-0c80cc24>Performance</h4><ul data-v-0c80cc24><li data-v-0c80cc24>Margaret Flanagan – Private Studio</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Edson Keen’s Showbiz School</li><li data-v-0c80cc24>Paul Flanagan – Ensemble Studios</li></ul></div></div>',1);function d(h,v){const a=e;return n(),t("div",null,[i(a),l])}const g=c(r,[["render",d],["__scopeId","data-v-0c80cc24"]]);export{g as default};
